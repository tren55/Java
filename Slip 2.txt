1.Write a java program to read ‘N’ names of your friends, store it into HashSet and display them
in ascending order.
import java.util.*;
public class slip2a {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
 Set<String> friends = new HashSet<String>();
 int n;
 System.out.print("Enter the number of friends: ");
 n = sc.nextInt();
 for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
 System.out.print("Enter the name of friend " + i + ": ");
 String name = sc.next();
 friends.add(name);
 }
 List<String> friendsList = new ArrayList<String>(friends);
 Collections.sort(friendsList);
 System.out.println("The list of friends in ascending order:");
 for (String friend : friendsList) {
 System.out.println(friend);
 }
 }

the servlet is running, such as the operating system type, and the names of currently loaded
servlets.
